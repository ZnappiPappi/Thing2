        // a) outline advantage of using a library [2] 2/2
        // - We do not have to repliacte standard functionality
        // - Even if we want to using the library is probably better anyways becayuse they arer probably tested
        // - It only took me a quick google search and ten seconds to have a robust collection of Arrival (a object I created) 
        LinkedList<Arrival> runway1 = new LinkedList<Arrival>();

        // b)  Evaluate the use of dynamic linked lists to static arrays when managing arriving airplanes. [4] 4/4
        // - There is no fixed amount of airplanes which are arriving, there will constantly be more, so it is more efficient using a dynamic linked list compared
        // to a static array as we don't have to allocate a fixed amount of space and risk over or under shooting the size.
        // - It is also much easier to manage a dynamic array, we are able to add and rmeove arrival airplanes more easily and traverse it.

        // c)  Sketch the resulting linked list when an airplane with ID RO225, STA 12:05 and delay 0 is added to this list.  [2] 2/2
